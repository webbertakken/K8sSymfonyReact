services:
  _defaults:
    # allow integration tests to access containers services
    public: true

    # If you need to access services in a test, create an alias
    # and then fetch that alias from the container. As a convention,
    # aliases are prefixed with test. For example:
    #
    # test.App\Service\MyService: '@App\Service\MyService'
